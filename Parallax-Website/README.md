# 3-Parallax-Website

<div align="right"><b>10/08/2022</b></div><br>

Here is my 3rd project. In this project, I created Parallax Website which people can have information about IT education company **ERESTU** 
With this project, I've learned how to build basic parallax website by using **HTML & CSS** features.I also created a brand named ERESTU and designed a logo and logo icon with AI. With the features that I would learn, I will build more spesific and detailed websites. Step by step, to achieving my goals.

Here you can see the project output:
