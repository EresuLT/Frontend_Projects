# Checkout-Form

<div align="right"><b>11/08/2022</b></div><br>

Here is my 4rd project. In this project, I've created a checkout form. With this project, I've learned how to build basic checkout form by using **HTML & CSS** features. 
With the features that I would learn, I will build more spesific and detailed websites.Step by step, to achieving my goals.

P.S: Zoom in for the media query.
