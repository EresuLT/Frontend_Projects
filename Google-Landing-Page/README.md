# Google-Landing-Page

<div align="right"><b>08/08/2022</b></div><br>

Here is my second project. In this project, I simulated Google's Landing Page.
With this project, I've learned how to build basic website page by using **HTML & CSS** features. With the features that I would learn, I will build more spesific and detailed websites and applications. Step by step, to achieving my goals.

Here you can see the project output:
