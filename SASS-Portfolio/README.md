# SASS-Portfolio

<div align="right"><b>13/08/2022</b></div><br>

Here is my 5th project. In this project, I created portfolio website. With this project, I've learned how to build tabbed website by using **SASS, HTML & CSS** features.  Also I used BEM notation for class identifications. 
With the features that I would learn, I will build more spesific and detailed websites. Step by step, to achieving my goals.

Here you can see the project output:
