# Survey-Form-Netflix

<div align="right"><b>06/08/2023</b></div><br>

Here is one of my first project. In this project, I simulated Netflix's survey form. 
With this project, I've learned how to build basic form page by using **HTML & CSS** features. With the features that I would learn, I will build more spesific and detailed websites. Step by step, to achieving my goals.

Here you can see the project output:<br>
